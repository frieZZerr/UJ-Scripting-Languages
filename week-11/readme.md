# Diary Summary Generator - Python vs Perl

The third script is a diary according to the specifications provided for the Perl version. It can be implemented either modularly or monolithically, depending on preference. The script should be able to handle a large file with thousands of lines as well as numerous short files, approximately 50 lines each. 

## Usage Example
```bash
python script1.py [options] input_file1.txt input_file2.txt ...
```

## Performance Test Results
The performance test was conducted using the Perl and the Python script. Both scripts were executed on several large files to compare their efficiency in processing a significant number of lines.

The test results demonstrate that:
- The average execution time of the scripts indicates that in this case Python performed almost 2 times better than Perl.
- It can be observed that the use of dictionaries in Python is faster and more efficient than in Perl.
