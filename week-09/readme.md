# Field Extractor with White Space Delimeter - Python vs Perl

This Python script functions similarly to the Perl script described in the first four specifications. It performs the same operations and adheres to the same specifications as described earlier.

Additionally, the script compares the efficiency of Python and Perl scripts by executing them on several large files simultaneously. The comparison aims to determine which language performs better for processing a large number of lines.

## Usage Example
```bash
python script1.py [options] input_file1.txt input_file2.txt ...
```

## Performance Test Results
The performance test was conducted using the Perl and the Python script. Both scripts were executed on several large files to compare their efficiency in processing a significant number of lines.

The test results demonstrate that:
- The average execution time of scripts without passing optional flags varies slightly, but the differences become noticeable when optional flags are passed. It is evident that Python performs slightly worse (slower) in executing computations compared to Perl.
- The execution time for the script written in Python increased by 18%, while in Perl, it increased by only 10%.
